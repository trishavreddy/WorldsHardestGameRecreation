# World's Hardest Game Recreation

A Java recreation of levels 1 and 10 from the 'World's Hardest Game' (CoolMathGames). Includes gameplay mechanics such as player movement, collision detection, and fail counters. Built with Java Swing and AWT for rendering graphics and handling events. Coded as part of my AP Computer Science A class in 10th grade.

## Features
- **Level Design:** Replicates layouts and challenges from levels 1 and 10.
- **Graphics:** 2D rendering with Java Swing and AWT.
- **Player Movement:** Arrow key navigation with boundary and collision checks.
- **Fail Counter:** Tracks the number of attempts to complete the level.
- **Multithreading:** Smooth animation and real-time updates using Java threads.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Java programming
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- GUI development (Java Swing and AWT)
- Event-driven programming (keyboard input handling)
- Collision detection
- Multi-threading for game loop and animations
- 2D graphics rendering
